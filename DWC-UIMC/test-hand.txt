改正基于距离的方法后：
	method:gaussian	missing_rate:0.1	accuracy:0.98
	method:gaussian	missing_rate:0.2	accuracy:0.975
	method:gaussian	missing_rate:0.3	accuracy:0.9775
	method:gaussian	missing_rate:0.4	accuracy:0.9775
	method:gaussian	missing_rate:0.5	accuracy:0.95
	method:distance	missing_rate:0.1	accuracy:0.9875
	method:distance	missing_rate:0.2	accuracy:0.975
	method:distance	missing_rate:0.3	accuracy:0.9575
	method:distance	missing_rate:0.4	accuracy:0.9575
	method:distance	missing_rate:0.5	accuracy:0.9225
基于距离的方法在缺失率较高时表现较差，改正后的方法在缺失率较高时表现较好。
重新生成缺失索引矩阵进行第二次比较：
